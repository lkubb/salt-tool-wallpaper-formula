# The different sources will be merged. For further information,

# Apart from the various source files, there are two independent source trees
# for user-specific configuration.
# Generally tool_wallpapers > tool_global.
# `tool_global` focuses on specific users, of which most values
# will be respected by all formulae in the `tool` suite:
tool_global:
  users:

      # The following is global configuration for the user named `user`.
    user:

        # Force the usage of XDG directories for this user.
      xdg: true

        # Sync this user's config from a dotfiles repo.
        # The available paths and their priority can be found in the
        # rendered `config/sync.sls` file (currently, @TODO docs).
        # Overview in descending priority:
        # salt://dotconfig/<minion_id>/<user>/wallpapers
        # salt://dotconfig/<minion_id>/wallpapers
        # salt://dotconfig/<os_family>/<user>/wallpapers
        # salt://dotconfig/<os_family>/wallpapers
        # salt://dotconfig/default/<user>/wallpapers

        dir_mode: '0700'      # default: 0700
        clean: false          # delete files in target. default: false

        # user to this file (will be appended to a file relative to $HOME)

        # for this user (will be appended to a file relative to $HOME)
      rchook: '.config/zsh/zshrc'

        # This user's configuration for this formula. Will be overridden by
        # user-specific configuration in `tool_wallpapers:users`.
        # Set this to `false` to disable configuration for this user.
      wallpapers:
          # This is the filename of the default wallpaper for this user.
          # In the future, I want to add more possibilities (resolution-dependent,
          # monitor-specific).
        default: rather_sick_wallpaper.png

tool_wallpapers:

    # Specify an explicit version (works on most Linux distributions) or
    # keep the packages updated to their latest version on subsequent runs
    # by leaving version empty or setting it to 'latest'
    # (again for Linux, brew does that anyways).
  version: latest

    # Default formula configuration for all users.
  defaults:
    default: default value for all users

    # User configuration can also be specified here in
    # `tool_wallpapers:users`. It will override
    # configuration sourced from `tool_global:users`.
  users:
    user:
      persistenv: '.bash_profile'
      wallpapers:
        default: this overrides config from tool_globl:users
